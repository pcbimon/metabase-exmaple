# About

A production ready docker compose file to deploy Metabase. Please refer to the official Metabase documentation for usage instructions.

## The compose file uses the following images:

- [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) – self-service BI reporting tool
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) – database server used by the Metabase application
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) – a reverse proxy that sits in front of Metabase and provides SSL termination (and generates [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates)

⚠️ Docker images are continuously updated so please check the version tags and decide if a newer version of the container would be more appropriate for your use case.

## Requires:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

# Getting started

1. Clone the template somewhere sensible, i.e. `/srv/metabase`
2. Duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to .env
3. Update the environment variables as needed
4. Update `db_password.txt`, `db_user.txt` and `mb_key.txt` following the instructions in each file.
5. Run `docker compose up -d` to create or update the docker containers from the compose file
6. Run `docker compose down` to shut down the containers
7. Ensure DNS is pointed correctly and you have ports `80` and `443` open on your firewall

## Available environment variables

`MB_DBNAME`: name of the database

`MB_HOST`: the public URL that people will access Metabase from (assumes DNS is pointed correctly)

`LE_EMAIL`: for expiry notices when your [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate is coming up for renewal
